# text_file_creation & taking the input commands from user , providing the out.txt as a ranking series for the students in class
'''Way for creating a text file using python code

Where the program will ask for the total student count in a class room & number of subjects that each student has scored out of 100.

and final 'in.txt' will looks like below :
<student_name>,<subject1_marks>,<subject2_marks>,<subject3_marks>

student-1,89,88,90
student-2,20,35,78



After we have in.txt file , we will be using that file to calculate the total marks obtained by the student for the subjects , & program will determines the his/her rank series
so 'out.txt' will look like below:

<student_name>,<subject1_marks>,<subject2_marks>,<subject3_marks>,<Total_marks>,<rank_series>

student-1,89,88,90,total_marks:(sum(89+88+90)),rank:1
student-2,20,35,78,total_marks:(sum(20+35+78)),rank:2
